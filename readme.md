3D Viewer for GLTF/GLB Models

This is a simple viewer for 3D models in GLTF or GLB format.  
It is suitable, for example, for displaying PCB models, such as those generated by KiCad.

[Live Demo (OSX Sensor with g-Sensor)](https://joembedded.github.io/viewer3d/index2.html)

## Features
- Display of GLTF/GLB models in the browser
- Mouse/Touch control (OrbitControls)
- Loading indicator during model loading

## Usage
1. Place the 3D model (e.g. `rak3172sip.glb`) in the directory
2. Copy the "MAGIC" blocks with script and CSS into your HTML page
3. Add the divs for the 3D content to the body; the loader div is optional
4. For each model, add an entry `view3d()` in the "MAGIC" block

## INDEX2.HTML
This demo uses a Bluetooth-Connection to display the orientation of a Sensor.
- Click 'Connect'
- If PIN is required: enter it as '.i PIN' manually (will be saved)
- Clicking 'Start' the model follows the real orientation (takes about 5 sec. to start)

## Dependencies
- [three.js](https://threejs.org/) - Stripped copy as local copy in ./three/...
